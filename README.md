# Tunnel-Onion-Token
A Ethereum side chain for decongestion, anonymity, and off chain compute

---Global Chain Variables---
branching factor <0-1> is the factor of how much a node will branch, 
   - 0  value as an extreme has the tunnels never branch
   - 1 value as an extreme has the tunnel branch to every node available
